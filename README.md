# portfolio
Source for my portfolio site

Previous version of this site was built with tailwind. But I wanted something minimal and quick to load.
But I also didn't have the time to write something from scratch. So I went with Bulma instead. I'll probably
try and rewrite this site using a static site generator (hugo, jekyll etc.) at some point.
